As my Outreachy internship moves along, and I'm learning just how much I love remote work. I love being able to set my own schedule, take a nap when I need to, cook during my lunch break, and workout when then gym's not crowded. Also, my couch is really freakin comfortable.

I was initially worried about remote work because I love pairing with people. I can happily work by myself and look up answers when I get stuck (my google fu is on point), but the way that I really cement knowledge is by pairing with someone who knows more than I do. It's a way for me to double check my assumptions, and clear up any confusions that I might have been glossing over. There's also a really good chance I'll learn something random, like new bash commands. I had gotten really used to doing this at Recurse Center because they encourage you to do it as much as possible, and I was worried about losing that opportunity when I started working remotely.

##__Enter Cloud9__

[Cloud9](http://c9.io) was built primarily as an all inclusive development environment in the cloud. While this is great and all, it's not really why I'm excited about it. I'm excited about it because it allows multiple people to work on the same project at once. It's different from screen-sharing programs like [Screenhero](https://screenhero.com/) which constrain you to literally sharing the same screen. Cloud9 allows you to work on the same files, but yours screens don't have to mirror each other. If we're both looking at the same file, I can see the other person's cursor and what they're typing, but I'm not constrained to looking only at the file that they're looking at. Pair programming I've done in the past is has consisted of one person talking and one person driving. This is definitely a different experience. I end up just saying my thought process out loud as I type, and then when I get stuck or want to see how they would do it, I ask. If we run into a bug, we can look in two separate areas and cover ground faster. While it does occasionally lead to both of us working on two separate things rather than both being engaged in one task, it feels more efficient and still provides the safety net of being able to ask questions and watch as they come up with solutions. The one glitch is that we both share the same terminal window, and whoever's window happens to be smaller constrains the other person's terminal. So my tiny laptop is seriously limiting to someone who has giant two monitors set up. They don't handle private .files, so you have to edit these in the terminal using vim, and the server is pretty slow getting set up, but overall it is a pretty nice system. My favorite part: they handle merge conflicts like a dream.

I don't know that it would ever replace the work that I do on my local machine, but it certainly makes collaborative programming easy, and provides an environment that both a sublime and an emacs users can agree on. I give it two (or four if you're pairing) thumbs up.

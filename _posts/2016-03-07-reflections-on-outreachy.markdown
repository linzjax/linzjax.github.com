I've written about Outreachy a number of times, but since today was my last day, I feel it's appropriate to write one final summary post. Who doesn't want a chance to tidy up all of their thoughts and put a nice bow on it?

[Outreachy](https://gnome.org/outreachy/) is a program dedicated to getting underrepresented members of the tech community involved in open source software through paid internships with partner companies. Much to my excitement (and surprise) I was accepted as Cadasta’s Outreachy intern for the winter session. I had been teaching myself to code for less than a year but had absolutely fallen in love with it, so I quit my job to spent three months at the [Recurse Center](recurse.com) in order to fully immerse myself. Armed with enough knowledge to get by but not enough real experience to be dangerous, Outreachy was an exciting next step towards becoming a full-time developer.

I don't know that I would have had the confidence to pursue coding as a career without the opportunity that Outreachy provided. Part of me was terrified at the thought of doing another internship. Right out of college, I got two internships back to back that both showed me (rather quickly) that the field I thought I wanted to get into was not for me, but they also didn’t feel like a solid step forward. I wasn't fetching coffee, but the work I was given was minimal and intern (i.e. error) proof. Going into Outreachy I expected something similar. I expected to be handed an endless list of bugs to fix, and to be told exactly what to do, when to do it, and how. It made sense. I didn’t have a lot of experience. Why would I expect anything different?

Day one I found out how misguided my expectations were. Everyone at Cadasta was unbelievably welcoming, and I was given responsibility for the entire Field Papers user interface redesign, with the expectation that it would be treated the same as any other project. I was provided with guidance by people who advised me on where to start, who pointed me in the right direction when I got stuck, and helped me make the final decisions along the way. I had walked in expecting to be handed a blueprint, but was instead asked to write the blueprint, build the scaffolding, and make the final touches. Admittedly, it was a little nerve-racking, and I kept expecting someone to stop me once they discovered I was sort of winging it.

But that was the point: this was an opportunity to learn how these projects work in a supportive and educational environment. I learned how to work with multiple companies on a single project, and that the end results of working with a team are vastly better than when you work alone without feedback. I learned to reach out frequently along the way to make sure I wasn't getting too attached to any one idea in particular or getting off track. I learned how to work collaboratively and substantially on open source projects that had a real impact beyond bug fixes. Most importantly, I gained confidence in my own ability in a way that feels tangible because I can point to a project that I completed, that got the approval of multiple people along the way. The opportunity that Outreachy and Cadasta provided for me is invaluable, and I can’t thank or recommend them enough.

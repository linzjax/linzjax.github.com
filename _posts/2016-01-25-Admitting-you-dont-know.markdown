Have I bragged about Recurse, or Outreachy lately? Oh, I have? Well, I'm going to do it again.

##__Reason #142 (or whatever)  why I'm thankful for Recurse/Outreachy:__

Recurse provided me with the courage and enthusiasm to admit when I don't know something, the excitement of being presented with completely new information, and the hubris to know that I could tackle any challenge put in front of me if given enough time and support. Saying "__I don't know what that is__" has become one of my favorite phrases. It's not admitting defeat, it's not revealing the fact that I secretly know nothing (buzz off imposter syndrome) - it's an opportunity. They get to feel good about explaining something, and I get to learn something new. It's a win-win situation.

When I initially got into programming, I started in python, but it never really clicked for me. I spent the entire time wondering how the user was going to interact with it. What were they going to see? So, I switched to JavaScript since front-end had a greater appeal to me. However, now that I'm comfortable with JavaScript, I find myself worry about the exact opposite: Now I've got something pretty the user can interact with, but it doesn't actually do anything. So when my mentor Ian took away my JavaScript crutches and asked if I wanted to learn Ruby on Rails I responded with a hearty "Hell yeah!" (ok I said something a little more of a professional like "Sure, I would love to", but that doesn't make for good blog rhetoric). I knew, due to the learning environment Outreachy and Cadasta had set up, this would be the perfect time to try something completely new. So being able to work with someone on back-end, someone who I'm actively encouraged to ask my stupid/basic/fundamental questions, is perfect. It's been great having Ian and everyone else at Cadasta be so responsive to my "__I don't know__" questions.

##__Why the thought of leaving this comfortable bubble worries me:__

I'm learning so much, and I'm having so much fun in this internship, but I'm aware that all good things must end. With March around the corner I've (unfortunately) started thinking about my next steps. While I'm excited about the prospect of finding my first "big kid" tech job, I'm concerned I'll never find an environment like this again. I had forgotten that RC and Outreachy/Cadasta are the exception, not the rule when it comes to culture. I went to a JS meet up the other day, and I was surprised at the people I talked to that felt the need to puff their chest out when talking about their experience. It felt like they were walking around with a giant "try me" button.

The majority of the people were lovely, very excited about the work that they were doing, and just happy to be surrounded by other like-minded programmers. The moderators were amazing, and overall I had a ton of fun. However, those few people were an interesting reminder that a safe learning environment is not a guarantee. How do you foster a learning environment if people are secretly terrified of being discovered as frauds?

I think Recurse Center's [social rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules) go a long way to solving this problem - no feigning surprise in particular. It makes it okay to admit ‘__I don't know__’ something, and creates a culture of excitement around introducing someone to something new. Rather than "HOW HAVE YOU NOT HEARD OF X, Y, AND Z?! HAVE YOU BEEN LIVING UNDER A ROCK?!" You get "OMG X, Y, AND Z IS AMAZING! COME! LET ME TAKE YOU ON A JOURNEY! YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT!" It shifts the focus to building others up instead of putting them down. Who knows, maybe there was someone else who didn't know about x, y, and z either. Now they get to learn something new rather than thanking their lucky stars they weren't stupid enough to ask the question.

I feel like it woudl be tough to judge this attitude in an interview process where admitting you don't know something feels like writing a giant ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ as an answer to a test question. Questions about mentorship and continued education only go so far as boiler plate answers, and besides, who says "nah, we hate that stuff" to a question like that. How do you really find out about the culture before signing on the dotted line?

##__The solution?__

I actually have no answers to this so…. ‘__I don't know!__’ (see what I did there?). So if anyone has any suggestions I'd love to hear them!

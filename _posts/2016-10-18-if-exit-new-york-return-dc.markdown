excerpt: "<p>'Brief' recap of my extended transition from NYC to DC.</p>"
---

While the whirlwind of the past few months has finally subsided, I still haven't yet digested everything that happened. I kept thinking to myself "Once this one thing is over, things will slow dow". Yeah. About that. That never happens. But I should still set aside time to recap.

It was definitely amazing (if at times stressful) few months. I'm looking forward settling into an apartment in DC and starting chapter 2 of my DC adventure!

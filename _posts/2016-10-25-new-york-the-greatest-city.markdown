So, I only lasted a year in New York. I remember my uncle telling me that he only made it a year in New York and was begging his job to let him leave by the end of it. I remember pridefully laughing at how silly this was: New York will be great! He just couldn't handle it. I can.

Little did I know.

Looking back I remember my very first impression of NYC: I took a trip there when I was in 8th grade. The only things I remember from that trip are Times Square and Central Park. My impression? It's gross, there's trash everywhere, and ohmygod there are way too many people. It was incredibly overwhelming, and I clung to the group that I was with for fear of being swept away in the sea of people, or having my bag stolen by the millions of pickpockets and criminals that littered the streets (or so I was told).

I travelled there again in 11th grade to take dance classes at Broadway Dance Center with the dance troupe that I had been in for six years. I have fonder memories of this trip. The dance classes were challenging, but exciting. We saw Chicago and Wicked. We ate at Serendipity. We went shopping along 5th Avenue. We ate at a five star restaurant you could only get to by going through the kitchen of a taco stand. This time around New York had more glitz and glamour, but still not in a way that I found inviting. It felt like a facade. It felt unattainable, or at the very least unsustainable. In the end, I still walked away happy to leave New York categorized under a fond, if odd, memory.

Flash forward seven years and I find myself in a serious relationship with a New York actor, a distain for the job that I was currently in, and the strong desire to hard pivot into coding full-time. All of this led me to Recurse Center, but my one concern was that it was in _New York_. I had bused back and forth to New York a couple of times in order to visit Nathan, but originally Nathan was the only thing that I looked forward to. With each visit, New York started to dig its claws in. I discovered what public transportation should be like (in comparison to WMATA), I learned summers don't have to be muggy disgusting swamps of humidity, but what really sold me was Central Park. It was a beautiful sea of calm in the midst of this whirlwind of people, or as someone once described it "the reason New Yorkers don't kill each other." If I could have spent every summer day lounging in Central Park, I would have. So, despite my reservations, when the acceptance letter from Recurse came, I jumped on it.

I moved into the top floor of a five story walk-up in the Cobble Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn. That climb never got easy, but the view from the roof was unbeatable. I was right across the street from Trader Joes, a block down from what would become my gym, and a 10 minute walk to 4 different subway lines. The spot was ideal. And while I was attending Recurse, I loved everything about New York. I had a built in friend group, activities to attend every night, free theatre to see, endless sights and sounds and opportunities. I attended parties with celebrities. I got to see the inside of many a tech giants headquarters. I was living the New York dream. And then Recurse ended.

Suddenly my place in New York felt less secure. The search for jobs left me feeling uncertain about myself, my career choice, my purpose in New York. Even when I eventually started my job at Cadasta, it no longer felt quite right being in New York. I worked from home everyday, which got progressively harder between the increasing heat and the constant construction on either side of my building. I attended fewer and fewer Recurse events because it never felt quite the same. The built in friend group I had became harder to get a hold of as everyone started their new jobs. Maybe if I had had a physical office with co-workers I might have maintained the feeling of belonging for a little while longer, but in reality there were a lot of other factors that played into my slowly loosing excitement for New York.

When Nathan mentioned the possibility of moving back to DC, I wasn't totally sure at first, but the more we talked about it, the more it just felt right. I had at one point loved New York. That feeling wasn't really there any more. It's a vibrant city that deserves every bit of the reputation that it's garnered - the good and the bad. This city forces growth or destruction in everything from buildings to resources to people. The growth that I experienced has a sort of complicated morality to it. It certainly hasn't made me 'nicer', but it's made me happier, stronger, and less apologetic about my existence.

### Be Assertive

I learned to be more assertive. New York doesn't have time for you to pussy foot around, it doesn't have time for your uncertainty, or unexpected politeness. Don't hesitate, don't second guess. You'll get run over. This counts in every situation: walking down the street, ordering food, getting on and off public transportation. No matter what, even if you're totally clueless, always at least act like you know what you're doing. If you need someone's attention, demand it. No one is going to give it to you freely. It's not that they're rude or don't care, they just literally do not have the emotional stamina to be aware of other human beings unless they absolutely have to.

### Don't apologize

I learned not to apologize for my existence. Women especially have a tendency to say "sorry" all the time. For everything. It's not my fault they were looking at their phone and ran into me. It's not my fault someone stepped out of a shop into the flow of sidewalk traffic and ran into me. It's not my fault they feel the need to take up two subway seats when I was sitting there first. It's not my fault someone abruptly stopped in front of me so I ran into them. I'm learning to not let "sorry!" be an unconscious reaction to all of these situations. I'll glare, get angry, role my eyes, yell at them. Or not. But I definitely won't apologize if I've done nothing to apologize for. Was it my fault? Did I do something wrong? Then no apologies. If that makes people think I'm rude that's their problem.

### Accept uncontrollable rage

I've been angry before. I've been upset by situations that any logical person would be upset by. But I have never known rage quite like that caused by NYC. There's something about the combination of being constantly jostled by other people, the noise, the smell, the overstimulation, the stress, and then waiting 30 minutes for subway only to get stuck on a train with no AC that spends a good ten minutes at every stop. That feeling of "WHAT IS HAPPENING AND WHY IS NO ONE DOING THEIR JOB I JUST WANT TO BE HOME". That unconsolable feeling piled on top of the heart breaking desire of just wanting to be home and alone and crying into a stiff drink. Something about all of this really puts things into perspective. I've learned to embrace it, and confront these feelings head on, so when they occur in a situation I'm actually in control of, I'm prepared to deal with them.

### Try new things

Literally everything in New York is a new thing, so this was a hard lesson to avoid, but it's something I've really learned to appreciate. I'm no longer afraid to travel on my own. I'm no longer afraid of any big city. I'm no longer afraid of talking to strangers, and I'm no longer afraid of trying "weird food". Life is far more exciting now.

### Embrace anonymity

I met so many people in NYC, but it got to the point where someone would introduce themselves, and my brain would not even register that they had said their name, let alone remember what it was. You just meet so many people, and there's a 90% chance you'll never see them again. While this might seem sad, it means those 10% really matter. There's also a certain freedom in knowing you'll never see people again. You don't have to worry about whether or not they like you. You don't have the pretend to be someone else because that's too much work for a stranger. I used to make it a goal to ensure everyone thought I was nice. It was very important to me. But to what end? Who cares. I'll never be rude or cruel, but I now refuse to shrink myself out of fear of being disliked. If they didn't like me, there are plenty of other people who will.

There's also a freedom that comes with this anonymity. There are so many people that New Yorkers have no time to register anyone else. So I could wear whatever I wanted, do whatever I wanted, and be whoever I wanted. No one cares, it doesn't matter. "Those who mind don't matter, and those who matter don't mind."

I'm grateful for New York. While I wish I could say that I'm thick skinned enough to really love living there, I can certainly say I'm glad that I at least tried. At the very least, it's made me appreciate things that I never thought I would in 8th grade: dishwashers, boredom, and silence.

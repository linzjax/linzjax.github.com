		    <p>It’s been two months since I applied, one month since I found out I got accepted, and four days since the beginning of the Outreachy internship, and yet somehow, <em>somehow</em> I’m still in denial about the fact that it’s actually happening.</p>

<p><strong>But it is.</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>How cool is that?</em></strong></p>

<p>So I’ve set aside my denial and decided to tell the world about my Outreachy journey. (Also, it’s a requirement of the internship, but I would have done it anyway. No really. Don’t look at me like that.)</p>

<p>As I was finishing up my batch at the Recurse Center, reality was starting to set in. If I really want to turn this hobby into a career, I have to start convincing other people (and myself) that I know what I’m doing. Outreachy seemed like a great place to start.</p>

<p>For those that don’t know, <a href="https://gnome.org/outreachy/">Outreachy</a> is a project that works to help underrepresented members of the tech community get involved in open source. You get to spend three months working with one of their partner companies on a project they’ve outlined. Open source has been an integral part of my journey to become a developer (see my <a href="">previous post</a> for more open source banner waving), and I was excited by the opportunity to continue working within the community.</p>

<p>So here I am, and I am so excited to be working with Cadasta! I’m thrilled to have the opportunity to combine design and development as I work with their team to rethink and redesign Field Papers’ UI. Over the next few weeks I’ll be blogging about my progress and musings along the way.</p>

<p>First installment: Research, rethink and redesign.</p>

<p>Until next time!</p>

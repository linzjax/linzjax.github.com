<p>A time for delusional fantasies and misplaced hopes. At least it provides motivation for me to finally get a gym membership. If I missed out on months of beautiful running weather because I “wasn’t feelin’ it”, there’s no way in hell I’m going to convince myself to go running when New York finally decides it’s time for winter. Maybe between a half-baked new year’s resolution and a $20 a month fee I’ll finally get my butt back in shape again (not that my butt doesn’t already have a lovely shape, but you know).</p>

<p>Eye-rolling sighs aside, this really is something I need to do. My health isn’t what it used to be. My stomach can’t handle eating three slices of cheesecake a day, no matter how hard I might try. Feeling tired, exhausted, and a kinda sad all the time is not really how I want to spend my time. So, after a few difficult goodbyes to my junk food collection and an awkward re-acquaintance with my tennis shoes (“oh, it’s you again…”), I’ve decided to start this blog as a way to keep myself accountable.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h1 id="my-goals"><strong>My Goals</strong></h1>

<p>Honestly, no section should start with “My Goals”. “What I hope to accomplish if maybe, for once, I can hold myself accountable to something longer than it takes to say ‘gosh my bed is warm’” would be much closer to the truth. Anyway…</p>

<p><strong>30 Day Reset</strong></p>

<p>My biggest problem is that Hashimotos has been kicking my butt for over a year now. My lab results are normal, but my gut and my brain are telling me otherwise. I’m going to stick to a 30 day reset with the AIP Protocol in an attempt to straighten things out, see how I feel, and then slowly introduce things back in.</p>

<p><strong>Go to the gym (more than once)</strong></p>

<p>Biggest perk of being in NYC: there are two gyms on the same block that I live. No excuses. If I’m spending $20 a month on a gym membership, I need to spend 20 hours a month (at least) in there. My knees aren’t what they used to be, and having a job that has me stuck at a desk for eight hours isn’t exactly helping me maintain my current physical status.</p>

<p><strong>Learn to play the guitar/tennis/rock climb/etc…</strong></p>

<p>I miss music. I miss being active. I used to be really good at both of those things, and it’s darn well time I brought them back into my life. Going to the gym is all well and good, but it should be for the goal of helping me get better at an activity I love, or don’t know that I love yet.</p>

<p><strong>Get a tech job</strong></p>

<p>I’ve dug my grave, now it’s time to lie in it. I quit my job, jumped off the deep end, and now it’s time to convince not only myself but others that I have skills that are useful and employable. I’m going to finish reading Eloquent Javascript, I’m going to stop having panic attacks at every Leet Code challenge, and I’m going to finally understand algorithms. Gonna do it!</p>

<p><strong>Stop spending hours on social media</strong></p>

<p>Why do I do this? Why do I care? It’s like my brain doesn’t know what to do if it’s not constantly entertained. I’m going to get a bedside clock so that I’m not tempted to stay in bed and stare at my phone. I’m going to start being more aware of my knee jerk reaction to open those apps. I’m going to find something more useful with my time.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>There are so many other things that I could list here, but I feel like this is a good start for the next few months, which is how I’m going to do this. A year is a very long time, and can seem daunting. A few months though, that’s not bad. I can reward myself after a few months, re-evaluate my goals, and start again. We’ll see how it goes!</p>

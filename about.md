## What I'm working on now:
-------
<br />

I "never graduated" from the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) in October of 2015, where I focused on JavaScript and explored full-stack frameworks. I'm now working with [Cadasta](http://cadasta.org/) through [Outreachy](https://gnome.org/outreachy/) on redesigning and improving the UI of [Field Papers](http://fieldpapers.org/).


## Just a few facts about me:
-------
<br />

I'm a self-taught JavaScript/Front-end developer with a focus on UI/UX.

I'm originally from Arkansas, and as a result have very strong feelings about BBQ.

I have traveled to 13 different countries, but never been to the west coast (one day Cali. One day).

I majored in anthropology and now I over-analyzing everything.

I enjoy painting when I have the time for it.

I took 13 years of dance lessons, and was a back-up dancer for drag shows in college.

I'm an opensource/opendata junkie (thanks a lot [Sunlight Foundation](http://sunlightfoundation.com/)).

I love good bourbon ([Rock Town: I'm looking at you](https://www.rocktowndistillery.com/)).

I get really excited about Halloween.

I think a dog smaller than my arm is not a dog.

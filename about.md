## Just a few fun facts

Hey y'all! I'm originally from Arkansas. I learned to spin fire in 2013. I've traveled to 13 different countries, and spent three months living in Florence. I can bend my thumb behind my hand, and I cut my own hair (for now).


##What I'm working on now

I'm currently "never graduating" at the Recurse Center where I'm expanding my knowledge of javascript and exploring full-stack frameworks.

The place where all of my chaotic notes are combined.

##I finally started a blog
I finally put aside all excuses and set up a personal website. 
It's a combination of my personal musings, and things I've learned along the way. 
It's built using Jekyll and a hack and slash custom layout.
Definitely still a work in progress, but isn't everything?

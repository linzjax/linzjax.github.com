THE SCARY STUFF
9. it can be really hard

10. you'll experience a hang over like you won't imagine.

11. no, everyone is NOT working on amazing projects 24/7 while you sit there trying to figure out what to do
-that said, if you're struggling to come up with a project you like, talk to facilitators, talk to other recursers, think of things that you wish existed that would benefit no one but yourself (and you'll be shocked how many other people are interested in it).

12. check-ins are scary, and tend to be a highlight reel, so don't let them intimidate you. It amazed me talking to someone who accomplished so much all the time that he felt intimidated during check ins. He was churning out projects every week, and still felt like he wasn't keeping up with people, so you know the system is a little skewed.

13. DONT WORRY ABOUT JOBS
going to say that again. DONT WORRY ABOUT JOBS. If you're landing strip is a little shorter than you'd like it to be, chat with Sonali and Nancy. They're great. They're there to help. But seriously, don't worry about it.

14. IT'S GREAT AND YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE IT
